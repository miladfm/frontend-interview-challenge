### Objective

In this challenge, your task is to retrieve data from `timeframes.ts` and render it like the provided designs. Use TypeScript and any popular frontend framework (e.g. Angular, React, Vue).

### Brief

Your challenge is to build out this personal ticket-tracking dashboard. A perfect opportunity to flex your CSS Grid muscles! Your task is to build the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. The designs are in PNG static format. Using PNGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`. You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

### Expected behavior

Your users should be able to:

-   [ ] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   [ ] Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
-   [ ] The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week," e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". It should read "Last Month" for monthly, e.g., "Last Month - 19hrs".

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **TypeScript** best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Style: use only `scss`
- Style: use css variable
- Dependencies: Don't use any external packages such as `tailwind`, `lodash` or anything else, we want to see your ability.
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Documentation: Add a short jsDoc for the most import part of code. such as `component`, `variable`, `model`, `component props/inputs`
- README.md: in `README.md` write a short document about:
  - How to start the app?
  - What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
  - What was the easiest part of this challenge?
  - If you need to provide any clarifications or additional information to the reviewer, please include it in the `ADDITIONAL NOTE` section of your project `README.md` file.

#### Nice to have:
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?
-   Theming: implement dark and light mode
-   Storybook: Add different stories for UI Component
-   Use Nx Workspace


All the best and happy coding!
